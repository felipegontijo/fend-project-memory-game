# Memory Game

## The Game

The Memory Game Project is a fun, interactive game in which the user has to try to match the cards by "flipping" (clicking on) them.
If the cards match, they stay "open" and indicate their matched status.
They are hidden otherwise.

## Metrics

Time: the game keeps track of the time the game's being played for, and displays it in real time for the user to see.
Rating: a stars-based rating is used to measure the user's "level". The more moves the user makes, the lower the rating -  which ranges from one to three stars.

## Win Game

The user wins when all cards have been matched, and they are informed so by a modal pop-up.
The user then has the option to play again.

## Restart

The game can be restarted at any time, may the user wish so, by clicking on the restart button on the top right corner.
