# Memory Game Project

## Nature of the Project

The Memory Game Project is a project from the Front-End Nanodegree program from Udacity. The student was provided with some HTML and CSS that displayed a static version of the project, having the need -- and goal, of turning it into an interactive game. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Original Repo

The HTML and CSS provided at the beggining of the project can be found in [this repository.](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game)
